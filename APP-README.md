# Read Me Generator

## Description
This project is designed in order to build a functional Read Me file for any application that one might use if they are using this generator.

This particular challenge highlighted some of my weaknesses, which included debugging. I had plenty of assistance with this in order to fully understand it due to real life set backs, but it has shown me that I need to be better at debugging the code and learning different tricks in order to do that successfully.

The operation of this application is reliant on using the Node function in the command line. To start, it is meant to be used by typing in 'node index' in order to start it. When it starts, it will prompt a list of questions that are necessary to write out a detailed Read Me file for an extensive application. Most of these are going to be using the input format, but the licenses are used with a list. This can be controlled by using the up and down arrow keys followed by the enter key in order to select it. By selecting it, it will prompt a badge to show up at the top of the Read Me File to show which license is being used for this in particular. Once all of the prompts are filled out, a read me file will generate along with a working table of contents.
