## Description of Application 
This quiz was designed to test knowledge in regards to horror films. It has five questions in its entirety and it is timed from sixty seconds. The theme of it is based on "Saw", which I haved used PNG images to create a little bit more of a dynamic, atmospheric tone to the project through CSS. The application opens with a header and a description of the game and what it entails. The Start Quiz button is there to advance into the first question, and all questions have four options that are evenly spaced and the same size one on top of the other. The answers are in different slots, so no answer is in the same place. After every answer, if you get it correct, it reflects it by tallying up the scores using 'if' statements in a function. It goes either way if it's correct or incorrect and appropriately tallies everything up. The countdown from 60 seconds is displayed uderneath the options as you go through each question and counts down appropriately. If you hit zero without finishing the quiz, it will display "The jig is up. Game over." and retain your score either way.
